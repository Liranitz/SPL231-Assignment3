Germany VS Japan
Game stats: 
General stats: 
Germany stats:ou believe Itakura's long ball from a free-kick in his own half is met by Asano, who beats Schlotterbeck with a beauty of a first touch. He darts into the box and smashes a shot from the tightest of angles, which beats Neuer and flies into the roof of the net!!! What a turnaround, what a story, and what a finish, to put Japan 2-1 up!!!


5400 - final whistle:

Well, what a way to kick off Group E! Germany sit at the bottom of the group following that defeat, while Japan are at the top with one win from one! Spain and Costa Rica are yet to play their corresponding fixture, but if the rest of the games are anything like this one, we're in for one hell of a treat, and a very competitive set of fixtures.
